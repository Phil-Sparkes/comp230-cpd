# Weekly Reports

## Week One

First week back and dropped straight back into it. Had a look round the new games academy building, the noise levels are a bit high but will see how it goes. With Brian this week we are working in C++ looking at OpenGL and SQL. Still not really got my head round C++ yet, only things I am capable of doing is following the tutorials. 

Looking forward to the VR module and working with the VR equipment. First assignment is making a website, this shouldnâ€™t be much of a problem since I have done HTML before. Making questionnaires and conducting interviews may be a challenge.

In 230 we looked at each of our ethical standpoints and how they vary amongst us. I am not really that motivated about this module as I much prefer working with code than working with words so may struggle with the writing of the essay.

Lastly my group for the group project had to pitch our worlds, I went a little away from the norm in this world pitch because I wanted to have something interesting to show. I felt like I talked too fast during the pitch and would need to work on this, making sure I practice the pitch beforehand.
