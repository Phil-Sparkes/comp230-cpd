# Weekly Reports

## Week One

First week back and dropped straight back into it. Had a look round the new games academy building, the noise levels are a bit high but will see how it goes. With Brian this week we are working in C++ looking at OpenGL and SQL. Still not really got my head round C++ yet, only things I am capable of doing is following the tutorials. 

Looking forward to the VR module and working with the VR equipment. First assignment is making a website, this shouldn’t be much of a problem since I have done HTML before. Making questionnaires and conducting interviews may be a challenge.

In 230 we looked at each of our ethical standpoints and how they vary amongst us. I am not really that motivated about this module as I much prefer working with code than working with words so may struggle with the writing of the essay.

Lastly my group for the group project had to pitch our worlds, I went a little away from the norm in this world pitch because I wanted to have something interesting to show. I felt like I talked too fast during the pitch and would need to work on this, making sure I practice the pitch beforehand.


## Week Two

This week during graphics and simulation we programmed a triangle, the amount of set up to code this triangle seemed a bit excessive, but I expect that this code will be used for later work as well. Once again, I felt like I wasn’t writing any of code myself this session but rather following Brian’s tutorial word for word.

For interfaces and Interaction, we had a look at the HoloLens. I am very interested in trying this out myself and seeing what it is capable of, may switch from doing a VR game to doing an AR one using this depending on how it works. We also looked at testing during this session which I have had experience in before.

For 230 we researched programming disasters, how little mistakes and lack of communication could cause rockets to explode. We also had a dialogue about dialogues. The dialogue approach seems interesting and I can see why it is used but I am finding it hard to contribute anything worthwhile to the conversation. 

As for the group project we have begun to prototype games, we are using unreal as the game engine, but I feel like the other members of the group do not know how long it can take to get stuff working in unreal. For example, I was asked to prototype a turn based strategy game in an hour. After telling them that it would probably take me my whole weekend to achieve this I offered the suggestion that it should be prototyped as a board game which they agreed with. I wish to improve the speeds in which I can prototype games.


## Week Three

This week in graphics and simulation we were using fragment and vertices shaders. I added some code to mine to make it change colour over time, this worked fine in the classroom but when I took it home It had a weird graphical glitch. I asked Brian about it and found out the cause but left it in anyway because it looked good.

For 220 we were looking at questionnaires and interviews, I feel like conducting these will be hard since 20 people is the recommended amount for the questionnaire and it is hard to get a good ratio of males to females. 

For 230 we were having more dialogues on the main ethical and professionalism topics. I contributed a couple of times during these dialogues but still not as much as I wish to do. It feels like it is the same people talking each week.

For the group project I was working on a random map generator. I made one using PyGame that created a grid based map but after asking the group they would prefer one that allowed for all shapes of rooms. I remade the generator and managed to get it working.

## Week Four

This week we turned our square into a cube following Brian’s tutorials

In 220 we had a worksheet on working with data, which I managed to complete and send to Al but it got corrupted when put onto the online version of Excel.

Also, this week managed to get my hands on the HoloLens which was a lot of fun, I managed to set it up so that it streamed to the computer in the VR room and gave the log in details to Moon.

Gathering data through questionnaires and interviews has proven to be hard, I managed to balance the male to females with the interviews at least via the help of online friends.

## Week Five

In 210 we were implementing Modelling and texturing into our projects, I could not get this working throughout the session and spent a long time trying to fix it after. Managed to find the problem eventually and it began to work.

For 220 this week I was focusing on making the website – Putting the results in graphs and tables.

For 230 our normal session was replaced with a group pitch for the game which I didn’t get to contribute to much, because I was using my time to work on the prototypes, our team managed to pitch it well but will try to offer more help with the pitch next time.


## Week Six

Week six was a studio practice week meaning we didn’t have any lectures but were required to come in and work. This week I worked a lot with the group on the group project.

I was also working on the 210 Research Journal and the 230 Essay, both of these are in for the same week so I tried to get as much progress on them as I could during this week.

A problem I found this week was working in the studio, the studio was too loud and distracting. I am going to get some noise cancelling headphones to try and counteract this.

## Week Seven

This week for graphics and simulation we had a peer review session, I managed to get the model loading and textured as well as a camera. The camera didn’t work fully though with only being to turn around.

For 210 we were studying how eyes work and how this information could be used for virtual and augmented reality. I found this lecture interesting and would like to try some eye tracking technology.

For 230 we were presenting out current findings of our research. This provided some useful feedback and sources that could be used for my essay.

For the group project we had some build troubles with the project not building due to people moving files around while others are working on the project. Managed to fix this after a strenuous hour and got a build working.


## Week Eight

This week we had three assignments in so the work load was high. For 210 we were trying to implement animation into our programs. Since Brian couldn’t get this working in the live coding there wasn’t much chance for us.

For 230 we had a peer review for our essay with the essay being in on the same day as the review, the feedback I got for this was useful but didn’t have the chance to change my essay since TeXworks was not working in the studio.

This week I also signed up for a unity exam which I forgot that I had, the day before I managed to do ten minutes of revision before the test. Got exactly 70% which was the required pass mark. This was cutting it a bit too close so I should make more time for revision next time.


## Week Nine

For 220 I was working on my VR project, I am finding it much harder than I thought it would be. Using the template VR project, I will see if I can duplicate the functionality for my own project. I plan on focusing more of my time towards the VR project now to make sure I can get something working quickly so I have enough time to work on the features before the deadline.

For the game project I finally implemented the map generator I had made during the prototyping. A few tweaks were needed to make it work with the new map but managed to get it working.

I also took part in volunteering this week, teaching teachers how to program with software Cornwall. Last year I also took part and there were 2-3 student volunteers but this year there was 6 of us. This caused a “too many cooks in the kitchen” problem and thus couldn’t provide much help.

## Week Ten

In 210 this week I had trouble getting the bullet physics to work in the session. This caused me to fall behind this week and had to work extra to catch up. I managed to catch up and now have physics in my project.

For the VR project I have managed to get some basic functionality, but the player movement does not work as intended. I am exploring ways of getting this to work.

The game project this week I was continuing from my progress last week. My team requested a spawn room and a boss room, using the map generator I managed to create the rooms and implement them into unreal. Also managed to fix the paths between rooms so that there are no longer holes in the wall. A problem with the game project is that I am having to program the bulk of the game when I want to program more specialist parts. I am trying to program specialist scripts but more of my time is invested into the main functionality programming for the game.
