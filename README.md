# Summary
My career goal is to work as a computing professional, I would like to work in the computing industry doing something programming related.

This course is helping me progress towards those goals by teaching me how to program as well as workplace practices. Resources such as GitHub and slack are used widely in the computing industry. I am learning how to use these tools effectively. Agile practices are also widely used so working in groups using agile methods will prepare me for my career goal.

Five challenges I have faced are as follows.
* Pacing in presentations
* Prototyping fast with team
* Collecting quantitative and qualitative data
* C++ pointers and references
* Working in studio

I plan to combat these challenges using SMART targets.


# Weekly Reports

## Week One

First week back and dropped straight back into it. Had a look round the new games academy building, the noise levels are a bit high but will see how it goes. With Brian this week we are working in C++ looking at OpenGL and SQL. Still not really got my head round C++ yet, only things I am capable of doing is following the tutorials. 

Looking forward to the VR module and working with the VR equipment. First assignment is making a website, this shouldn’t be much of a problem since I have done HTML before. Making questionnaires and conducting interviews may be a challenge.

In 230 we looked at each of our ethical standpoints and how they vary amongst us. I am not really that motivated about this module as I much prefer working with code than working with words so may struggle with the writing of the essay.

Lastly my group for the group project had to pitch our worlds, I went a little away from the norm in this world pitch because I wanted to have something interesting to show. I felt like I talked too fast during the pitch and would need to work on this, making sure I practice the pitch beforehand.


## Week Two

This week during graphics and simulation we programmed a triangle, the amount of set up to code this triangle seemed a bit excessive, but I expect that this code will be used for later work as well. Once again, I felt like I wasn’t writing any of code myself this session but rather following Brian’s tutorial word for word.

For interfaces and Interaction, we had a look at the HoloLens. I am very interested in trying this out myself and seeing what it is capable of, may switch from doing a VR game to doing an AR one using this depending on how it works. We also looked at testing during this session which I have had experience in before.

For 230 we researched programming disasters, how little mistakes and lack of communication could cause rockets to explode. We also had a dialogue about dialogues. The dialogue approach seems interesting and I can see why it is used but I am finding it hard to contribute anything worthwhile to the conversation. 

As for the group project we have begun to prototype games, we are using unreal as the game engine, but I feel like the other members of the group do not know how long it can take to get stuff working in unreal. For example, I was asked to prototype a turn based strategy game in an hour. After telling them that it would probably take me my whole weekend to achieve this I offered the suggestion that it should be prototyped as a board game which they agreed with. I wish to improve the speeds in which I can prototype games.


## Week Three

This week in graphics and simulation we were using fragment and vertices shaders. I added some code to mine to make it change colour over time, this worked fine in the classroom but when I took it home It had a weird graphical glitch. I asked Brian about it and found out the cause but left it in anyway because it looked good.

For 220 we were looking at questionnaires and interviews, I feel like conducting these will be hard since 20 people is the recommended amount for the questionnaire and it is hard to get a good ratio of males to females. 

For 230 we were having more dialogues on the main ethical and professionalism topics. I contributed a couple of times during these dialogues but still not as much as I wish to do. It feels like it is the same people talking each week.

For the group project I was working on a random map generator. I made one using PyGame that created a grid based map but after asking the group they would prefer one that allowed for all shapes of rooms. I remade the generator and managed to get it working.

## Week Four

This week we turned our square into a cube following Brian’s tutorials

In 220 we had a worksheet on working with data, which I managed to complete and send to Al but it got corrupted when put onto the online version of Excel.

Also, this week managed to get my hands on the HoloLens which was a lot of fun, I managed to set it up so that it streamed to the computer in the VR room and gave the log in details to Moon.

Gathering data through questionnaires and interviews has proven to be hard, I managed to balance the male to females with the interviews at least via the help of online friends.

## Week Five

In 210 we were implementing Modelling and texturing into our projects, I could not get this working throughout the session and spent a long time trying to fix it after. Managed to find the problem eventually and it began to work.

For 220 this week I was focusing on making the website – Putting the results in graphs and tables.

For 230 our normal session was replaced with a group pitch for the game which I didn’t get to contribute to much, because I was using my time to work on the prototypes, our team managed to pitch it well but will try to offer more help with the pitch next time.


## Week Six

Week six was a studio practice week meaning we didn’t have any lectures but were required to come in and work. This week I worked a lot with the group on the group project.

I was also working on the 210 Research Journal and the 230 Essay, both of these are in for the same week so I tried to get as much progress on them as I could during this week.

A problem I found this week was working in the studio, the studio was too loud and distracting. I am going to get some noise cancelling headphones to try and counteract this.

## Week Seven

This week for graphics and simulation we had a peer review session, I managed to get the model loading and textured as well as a camera. The camera didn’t work fully though with only being to turn around.

For 210 we were studying how eyes work and how this information could be used for virtual and augmented reality. I found this lecture interesting and would like to try some eye tracking technology.

For 230 we were presenting out current findings of our research. This provided some useful feedback and sources that could be used for my essay.

For the group project we had some build troubles with the project not building due to people moving files around while others are working on the project. Managed to fix this after a strenuous hour and got a build working.


## Week Eight

This week we had three assignments in so the work load was high. For 210 we were trying to implement animation into our programs. Since Brian couldn’t get this working in the live coding there wasn’t much chance for us.

For 230 we had a peer review for our essay with the essay being in on the same day as the review, the feedback I got for this was useful but didn’t have the chance to change my essay since TeXworks was not working in the studio.

This week I also signed up for a unity exam which I forgot that I had, the day before I managed to do ten minutes of revision before the test. Got exactly 70% which was the required pass mark. This was cutting it a bit too close so I should make more time for revision next time.


## Week Nine

For 220 I was working on my VR project, I am finding it much harder than I thought it would be. Using the template VR project, I will see if I can duplicate the functionality for my own project. I plan on focusing more of my time towards the VR project now to make sure I can get something working quickly so I have enough time to work on the features before the deadline.

For the game project I finally implemented the map generator I had made during the prototyping. A few tweaks were needed to make it work with the new map but managed to get it working.

I also took part in volunteering this week, teaching teachers how to program with software Cornwall. Last year I also took part and there were 2-3 student volunteers but this year there was 6 of us. This caused a “too many cooks in the kitchen” problem and thus couldn’t provide much help.

## Week Ten

In 210 this week I had trouble getting the bullet physics to work in the session. This caused me to fall behind this week and had to work extra to catch up. I managed to catch up and now have physics in my project.

For the VR project I have managed to get some basic functionality, but the player movement does not work as intended. I am exploring ways of getting this to work.

The game project this week I was continuing from my progress last week. My team requested a spawn room and a boss room, using the map generator I managed to create the rooms and implement them into unreal. Also managed to fix the paths between rooms so that there are no longer holes in the wall. A problem with the game project is that I am having to program the bulk of the game when I want to program more specialist parts. I am trying to program specialist scripts but more of my time is invested into the main functionality programming for the game.

## Week Eleven

For graphics this week we were looking over our code and refactoring it, this seemed easy enough to understand but proved my knowledge on how pointers and referencing works in C++ is still not adequate. I plan on looking further into how they function.

For the VR project after a considerable amount of effort I managed to fix the movement issues and decided that I would like some tracker functionality in the game. I have created a special weapon for the game that will only activates with a fast movement from the VR tracker and now working on getting the tracking side working.

For the game project we managed to start play testing finally, this gave some valuable feedback about the game such as weapon balancing, I provided the designers with a way of accessing all the weapon properties without having to delve into the code. This in turn gives them the power to act on the feedback and balance the game.

## Week Twelve

This week I didn’t work on my graphics project since I had two other deadlines in. The first of which being the game project. For this we had a team meeting and a list was created of all the features we wanted finished before the deadline. I completed all the tasks from the list and refined some of the code to keep it clean. We also had to create a video showing off our game, the other programmer and I agreed to meet at my house to make the videos at the same time. After a lot of fiddling with the editing software we managed to get the videos done. I submitted mine but was then told the audio level was too low, I resubmitted it with a higher audio level.

The other assignment in for this week was the VR project. I was pleasantly surprised with how this turned out, with the top down shooter mechanics in a VR game. The idea of the project was to see if these mechanics would work in VR and I believe they do work.


# Term 2

# Summary
My career goal is to work as a computing professional, I would like to work in the computing industry doing programming related work.

This course is helping provide the insight to the programming and workplace practices. Resources such as GitHub and slack are used widely in the computing industry. I am learning how to use these tools effectively. Since I have started this course I have made large step towards this end goal. The main problem I feel like I will face will be switching from the university environment to a workplace environment. To understand this better I would like to get some experience working in the industry.

Five challenges I have faced are as follows
*	Managing stress levels
*	Maintainability in unreal code
*	Prioritising work 
*	Communication with team 
*	Applying more complex AI to game

I plan to combat these challenges using SMART targets.


## Week 1

This week we had our introductions to our new modules, I am looking forward to the AI module as this is something I have an interest in. The networking module is quite technical with talking about socket programming this week. It seems there will be a lot of writing this study block which I may struggle with. A 14-page business report feels a bit extensive for the marks that it is worth. A problem I found this week was regaining motivation after the holidays, in the team project we jumped right back in, but the work output is not as high as it could be.

## Week 2

For networking this week, we were creating a SUD (Single user dungeon). I found this simple enough to do but have a feeling that this module will soon become very challenging with the networking side. For AI we looked at the Nash equilibrium, I found this interesting and would like to incorporate the techniques into some of my programs. The main problem I experience this week was time management with the group project. We have settled for three full days in the studio (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), but I find myself doing too much group project work compared to other work.

## Week 3

In AI lecture this week we were looking into other methods of incorporating AI focusing on behaviour trees and finite state machines, in this session I managed to create a basic behaviour tree using unreal which I plan to now incorporate into the game. For networking we were working on our SUDs and turning them into MUDs. so far, I have managed to get the SUD working from a single remote client. The main problem I had this week carries on from the last week with spending too much time on the group project, but I feel like the group project is something I want to be heavily invested in.

## Week 4

For AI this week the topic was Minmax algorithms. I can see how these could be useful in many applications but my current project I don’t see how I would be able to incorporate this efficiently. My main problem this week was not being able to get the networking working using threading, this proved much more difficult than it first appeared. I found that most of my peers were also struggling with this and we arranged a session with Gareth to provide us with some support in the subject. I also took a step back from the game project this week to try and focus on other work.

## Week 5 

This week was useful for our business assignment as we had a presentation that went through all the topics that we are required to write about, I feel the amount of work required for the assignment is a bit excessive especially with all the other work we also must do. We also have a business presentation coming up in which I am not sure what I need to present. In AI we studied the Monte Carlow tree search, this is another technique that I have found interesting and would like to test in a program.

## Week 6 

This week was studio practice week, during this week I mostly worked on my group project game with the team, we felt like if we managed to get a lot of the work done this week then we will have more free time for other assignments later. A problem I found was communicating with my team and letting them know that I wouldn’t be able to dedicate much time on this project anymore due to other work.

## Week 7

This week I was struggling with illness, I missed both 250 and 240 lectures. I missed the business presentation, I messaged Gareth about what I should do for this. He requested that I make a video of me doing the presentation and send it his way which I managed to do. Due to missing sessions this week I am finding it hard to understand the presentation material and catch up on the work.

## Week 8 

This week in AI we studied evolutionary algorithms which was also my topic for the research journal. I am very interested in this topic and have wrote about it in a paper during first year. I feel confident that I am able to use evolutionary algorithms for my programs. Last year I made a genetic algorithm to play the game QWOP, after this session I would like to go back to this algorithm and make some changes to see if I can improve my previous work. The main problem I found this week was knowing what to write about for my business report. Although lots of material was provided I still was not sure what I should be writing about in each section.

## Week 9

After being out of the country and away from a computer for my whole Easter break I came back to a fairy large amount of work that needed to be done. I missed a few lectures and some dedicated studio practice time with my team this week. I feel this was because I got overwhelmed with the amount of work that I had to do so I just shut down and did none of it. Over the weekend I did manage to do a sizable chunk though to make sure I did not fall too far behind.

## Week 10

This week I have been continuing with trying to catch up with work. I have found it quite stressful and having to suspend my social activities for a while to focus on the work. One problem I have noticed with my code on the group game is the lack of maintainability. Lots of my old code was hard to understand and other bits were redundant. We have had a bad experience deleting files from unreal as it often breaks the build but next year I plan on having a better file system and less redundant files.

## Week 11

This week was very busy with lots of assignment deadlines coming up, during AI lecture we had some guest lecturers from the MetaMakers AI. I feel like this was a bad time to have this though as I was so busy with work that I couldn’t give the guest lecturers the attention they deserved during their talks. For the group project I had to stay in late a couple days to get the project up to a standard in which it was ready to submit. The day we decided to submit I had to spend a very busy hour fixing the bugs but we managed to get it all done and hand in the game. For the game submission I also submitted a poster which was not due till the week after. This is good though because now I don’t have to worry about doing it next week alongside all my other work.

## Week 12

This week was more hand-ins with the main focus being on the AI bot. For this assignment I made a bot that would get to the top of the leader board but I didn’t try many different AI techniques. The reasoning behind this is because for this sort of game I thought the more heuristic based AI would perform the best. Doing this though I missed the opportunity to experiment more with different types of AI. This week I was also working on networking in which I have been struggling with at one point getting locked out of my server and having to ask for assistance. I have managed to make some progress after getting some help from peers.
